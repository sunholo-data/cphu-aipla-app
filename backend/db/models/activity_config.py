"""ActivityConfig — per-teacher, per-class, per-activity configuration.

Stores the teaching goal that gets injected into a skill's system prompt
at agent-instantiation time via the ``{teacher_focus}`` placeholder. See
``adk/teacher_focus.py`` for the wrapper that performs the substitution.

The doc id is the composite ``{teacher_uid}:{class_id}:{activity_id}`` so
each (teacher, class, activity) tuple has exactly one config row — saves
a query when the agent boots up.

Phase 2 scope (1.G-Ph2): LOCAL_MODE teacher stub owns one seeded demo
class. Firebase teacher auth + multi-class ownership land in Phase 3
(1.G-Ph3) — the access-control field is wired here so the swap is a
no-op in routes.
