"""Browser TTS provider — signal-only.

The browser path doesn't synthesize on the backend; the frontend calls
`window.speechSynthesis` locally. This provider exists so the registry
can return *something* for `name="browser"`, and the voice route can
detect it and signal the frontend ("you handle it locally") rather
than serving an audio blob.

The `.synthesize()` method raises NotImplementedError on purpose. The
route layer (M-A5) checks `provider.name == "browser"` and returns a
JSON `{"provider": "browser"}` response instead of calling synthesize.
