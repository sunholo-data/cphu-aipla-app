"""Routine compaction stays out of the student's turn (COMPACTION-LATENCY M1).

Upstream measured, 2026-08-06, 18 real turns against a live backend:

    TTFT   14,682 -> 28,326 ms   (+13.6s)
    tail    3,141 -> 31,330 ms   (+28.2s)
    worst turn: 90s total — and EVERY compacting turn compacted TWICE.

Twice because ADK runs two compaction paths and both fired on the same turn.
The pre-request one lands in TTFT: the student waits, looking at nothing, while
we summarise a conversation already on their screen. The post-invocation one
runs at the end of a turn — already the right moment, since that is when the
student starts reading.

The fix rests entirely on the two paths reading DIFFERENT config objects, so
that is pinned here as an ADK contract: if a future google-adk merges them,
this file fails loudly rather than silently restoring 13.6s of TTFT that
nobody would think to re-measure.
