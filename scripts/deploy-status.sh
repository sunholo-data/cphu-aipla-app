#!/usr/bin/env bash
# deploy-status.sh — what is ACTUALLY running in each environment?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-08-04). Restoring prod after INFRA-1, the version to
# promote was taken from two sources that both said v0.1.4: the dead Cloud Run
# revision, and docs/ops/deployed-urls.md. Both were stale — test had moved to
# v0.1.5 the day before. Prod was restored a release behind, and nothing in the
# process would have caught it.
#
# The deploy runbook's own example is `make promote VERSION=v0.1.4 …`, which is
# exactly the number that was wrong. A runbook cannot carry a current version,
# and a doc that must be hand-updated on every tag will drift. So: ask the
# services.
#
# WHY IT FAILS CLOSED (2026-08-13). The first version sent gcloud's stderr to
# /dev/null, so PERMISSION_DENIED and "Reauthentication failed" both collapsed
# into an empty image string, which version_of() rendered as "(not deployed)".
# Two identical "(not deployed)" strings then compare EQUAL — so the script
# signed off "test and prod are level ((not deployed))" having read nothing at
# all. A green verdict from zero data, in the one script whose entire purpose is
# to stop the promote step trusting a number nobody checked. Run under an
# account without access and it told you what you wanted to hear.
#
# So: only "Cannot find service" means not-deployed. Every other failure is
# named, and the script refuses to render a parity verdict and exits non-zero.
# Same principle as check-iam-posture.sh and check-domains — a checker that
# cannot read its subject must say so, not answer anyway.
#
# Read-only. Run before any promotion.
