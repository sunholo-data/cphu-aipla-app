# `auth.get_current_user`               → dispatcher: Firebase JWT *or* the
#                                         anonymous-group student JWT (ADR-001).
# `auth.firebase_auth.get_current_user` → Firebase ONLY. A student's group token
#                                         dies at `verify_id_token` → 401
#                                         "Invalid token", on EVERY request,
#                                         unrecoverably (the token is fine, so
#                                         no amount of refresh helps).
#
# Cost of not having this (2026-08-14, v0.1.20): writing / checklist /
# concept per-group progress all imported the Firebase-only symbol. Student
# writing autosave 401'd on prod for every group, so the text survived only in a
# tab-scoped sessionStorage buffer and died with the tab. Live for 3 days on the
# newest route and over a month on the oldest.
#
# Why unit tests could not catch it: each route's tests `dependency_overrides`
# the same symbol the route imports, so they pass in lockstep with the bug. An
# overridden dependency never exercises the dispatch. Real coverage needs a real
# minted group token — see tests/api_tests/test_dual_auth_rejection.py.
#
# TEACHER/RESEARCHER-only routes are legitimately Firebase-only; they are listed
# in ALLOWLIST below, with the reason. Adding a name here is a claim that NO
# anonymous-group student ever calls that route.
