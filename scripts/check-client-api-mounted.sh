# check-client-api-mounted.sh — an exported API-client function with no caller is
# a feature the user cannot reach.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (1.1.135 / TUTOR-2 M6, 2026-09-29).
#
# CLAUDE.md carries the row "A whole stack ships with the control unmounted: the
# endpoint works, the API client has a passing test, and the user cannot do the
# thing". It has fired at least four times — `patchClass` (a teacher could not
# rename a class for months), ALS-SHARE M3b (researcher edit/unpublish/delete,
# three months with no call site while three pages said read-only), and twice
# more found while writing 1.1.135. The row is marked **manual**.
#
# Manual did not work. Writing 1.1.135 I hand-audited this exact question and got
# it wrong IN BOTH DIRECTIONS in one sitting: I reported `createCustomApproach`
# as unmounted when it is mounted and tested (I had grepped a function name I
# invented), and I missed six exports that genuinely were. A design doc, a sprint
# plan and two commit messages went out with the wrong claim in them.
#
# So this is the mechanical version. It cannot be fooled by a misremembered name.
#
# ⚠️ A TEST IS NOT A CALL SITE. That is the whole point of the footgun row — "a
# test on the client function proves the client function". Test files are
# excluded from the search deliberately; do not "fix" a failure by adding a test.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-client-api-mounted.sh   (make check-client-api)
